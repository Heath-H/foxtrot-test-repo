# intro to github

## Foxtrots first github extravaganza

## git process

- Created a repo
- cloned the repo --> there is a repo on github and you need it locally
 - local - your computer 
 - remote - github, the cloud...

- make a file - touch <new-file-name> make sure you have extension 
 - make sure you are inside the repo - cd repo-name
 - naming conventions - lowercase, no spaces
 - extensions - which type of file

- added content
- added the PAT (personal auth token)

- Loacal --> remote
 - git status
 - git add . (sidenote: you can do git add <filename>)
 - git commit -m "message" - Like a patch note. make it so others and future self knows what this commit actually did
 - git push origin <branch-name>
